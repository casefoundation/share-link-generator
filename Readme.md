This tool helps you build share URLs for various social networks. For Twitter and Email you may also use scraped metadata from those URLs to prepopulate the share text. To use scraped terms like the title, publisher, URL, or author from a URL, surround them in double squiggly brackets like this: {{ }}. For example, you may use this text for Twitter: "Check out {{ title }} by {{author}}! {{ url }}"
